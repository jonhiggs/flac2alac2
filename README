flac2alac is a shell script to convert FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) files
to ALAC (Apple Lossless Audio Codec) format, used on iPod/iPhone/iPad.

You can use it to convert a single .flac file to .m4a, like

  flac2alac file.flac

You can use it to convert a directory of files:
 
  flac2alac *.flac

You can use it to remove the original files after successful conversion:

  flac2alac -d *.flac

Users of this program may find the "ppss" (parallel processing shell script)
tool useful for converting large batches of files on modern, multi-core
machines.

  Download at:  http://code.google.com/p/ppss/

To convert an entire directory using all of your available cores:

  ppss -d . -c 'flac2alac '

Or, to delete after:

  ppss -d . -c 'flac2alac -d '

(One note: ppss by default recurses through all of the subdirectories of the
directory specified by the '-d' option.  More info can be found in the ppss
docs.)

flac2alac uses flac and ffmpeg to decode/encode the audio files. On Ubuntu, you
can install them with

 make install

If you have homebrew on OSX you can install with

  make install-homebrew

Also required is the mpeg4v2 package that includes the mp4tags utility, fetch
it from here:
